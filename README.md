Iris Flower Classification
This project focuses on classifying iris flowers using the Iris dataset. It employs the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for accurate classification based on flower measurements. The project provides an example of data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation. It also includes visualizations of the predicted and actual flower classes.

Features: 
Loads and preprocesses the Iris dataset
Splits the dataset into training and testing sets
Applies the KNN algorithm for classification
Evaluates the model's accuracy and performance metrics
Visualizes predicted vs actual flower classes
